* `EventTarget` interface
* `EventType` class
* `EventHandler` interface

## Event Classes

* Hierachy:
    * `Event`
        * `InputEvent`
            * `KeyEvent`
            * `MouseEvent`
            * `TouchEvent`
            *...

        * `WindowEvent`
        * `ActionEvent`
        
* `WindowEvent` includes showing and hiding a window. `ActionEvent` includes firing a button, or a menu item.

* `Event` class provide some common methods:

|  method         |    description     |
|-----------------|--------------------|
| getSource()     | Get the source object of the event. The source will change as the event propagate through the event dispacher chain. |
| getTarget()     | Get the target object of the event. |
| getEventType()  | Event type | 

* Specific event classes have more properties. `MouseEvent` class:

|  method         |    description     |
|-----------------|--------------------|
| getX()          | x coordinate of the mouse relative to the source of the event. |
| getY()          | y coordinate of the mouse relative to the source of the event. |

## Event Types

* Event types are used to further differenciate different events.

* Hierachy
    * Event.ANY
    * InputEvent.ANY
        * KeyEvent.ANY
            * KeyEvent.KEY_PRESSED
            * KeyEvent.KEY_RELEASED
            * KeyEvent.KEY_TYPED
        * MouseEvent.ANY
            * MouseEvent.MOUSE_PRESSED
            * MouseEvent.MOUSE_RELEASED
            * MouseEvent.MOUSE_CLICKED
        * ...
    * `WindowEvent.ANY`
        * `WindowEvent.WINDOW_SHOWING`
        * `WindowEvent.WINDOW_HIDING`
        * ...
    * `ActionEvent.ANY`

## Event Processing Mechanism

* The default **event route** 
consists of the container-children path starting at the stage to the event target node.

* Two phase in event traversal:
    * **Capture Phase**
    * **Bubbling Phase**

### Capture Phase

* The dispatcher traverse nodes in container-child direction. 

* As the dispatcher passes through a node, the registered filters are called. The filter can stop the propagation by **consuming** the event.

### Bubbling Phase

* The dispatcher traverse nodes in child-container direction.

* As the dispatcher passes through a node, the registered handlers are called. The filter can stop the propagation by consuming the event.

## Registering Event Handlers

* `EventHandler<Event>` class can be registered as event filters, event handlers, or both.

* Registering event filters/handlers in two ways:

    * Using the `addEventFilter()`, `addEventHandler()`, `removeEventFilter()`, and `removeEventHandler()` methods.
    
    * Using `onXXXHandlers` properties.
    
* `addEventFilter()`, `addEventHandler()` can add multiple filters, handlers.
Example.
```java
node.addEventFilter(Event.ANY, handler);
```

* `setOnXXXHandlers` can only register one event handler. `setOnXXXHandlers(null)` unregisters it.

## Execution Order

* Filters are executed first. Handlers are executed last.

* Filters/handlers of a specific type are called before filters/handlers of a more generic type.

* Handlers registered with `addEventHandler()` are executed befre the handler registered with `setOnXXXHandler()`

* The order of filters/handlers of the same type are undefined.

##Consuming Events

* An event is consumed by calling its `consume()` method.

* If an event is consumed in an event filter
of a node, the event does not travel to any child node. If an event is consumed in an event handler of a node,
the event does not travel to any parent node.

* Typical usage: If a parent node does not want its child nodes to respond to an event, it can consume the event in its event filter. If a parent node provides a default response to an event in an event handler, a child node can provide a specific response and consume the event.

* At the consuming node, all filters/handlers of the right type are called. 

* Consuming the event in event filters at the target node prevents the bubbling phase.

## Mouse Events

## Key Events

* Types of key events:
    * `ANY`
    
    * `KEY_PRESSED`
    
    * `KEY_RELEASED`
    
    * `KEY_TYPED`

* `KEY_TYPED` events are high level events. It indicates a UTF-8 character has been entered. 

* One `KEY_TYPED` event can be generated by multiple `KEY_PRESSED` events. Eg. Shift+a.



* One `KEY_PRESSED` event may not generated a `KEY_TYPED` event. Eg. F2.

* Get returning key stroke

|   Method    | Valid For | Description    |
|-------------|-----------|----------------|
|  `KeyCode getCode()`  |  `KEY_PRESSED`, `KEY_RELEASED` |  The KeyCode enum contains a constant to represent all keys in the keyboard. |
|  `String getText()`  | `KEY_PRESSED`, `KEY_RELEASED`  |  String description of the KyCode |
|  `String getCharacter()`  | `KEY_TYPED` |  UTF-8 character typed represented as String | 


* The `isAltDown()`, `isControlDown()`, `isMetaDown()`, `isShiftDown()`, and `isShortcutDown()` methods return modifier keys associated with the mouse event.

## Window Events

* Types:
    * `ANY`
    * `WINDOW_SHOWING`
    * `WINDOW_SHOWN`
    * `WINDOW_HIDING`
    * `WINDOW_HIDDEN`
    * `WINDOW_CLOSE_REQUEST`
